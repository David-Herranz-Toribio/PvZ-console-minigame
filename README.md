# PvZ-console-minigame
My university's project and my first time playing with OO programming.
This is the mythic Plants vs Zombies, but made by me and on console.
to play you have to select a difficulty (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) and an ID (0-50)
All comands and plants can be displayed by the Help command (h).
I know there are a bunch of optimization and logic errors, but being this my first time programming on java the miracle is that it works.
